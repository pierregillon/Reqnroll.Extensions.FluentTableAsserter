A specflow extension library to simplify table assertion with fluent code.

## Installation

[Nuget package](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Crafty.Specflow.Extensions.FluentTableAsserter):

    dotnet add package Crafty.Specflow.Extensions.FluentTableAsserter

## Why?

Asserting Specflow table can be very painful in large scale application.
Even
if [SpecFlow.Assist Helpers](https://docs.specflow.org/projects/specflow/en/latest/Bindings/SpecFlow-Assist-Helpers.html)
is a good start to simplify data rehydration from table, it is not very flexible.

The idea to this library is:

- very little code required
- can be extended with **extra configuration**
- avoid creating `record` or `class` for every single table to rehydrate
- tend to be **ubiquitous language centric** (clever string parsing from *human readable* input)
- make column declaration **optional** in gherkin, in order to declare only the columns that are
- relevant for a scenario

## Examples

For the following scenario:

```gherkin
Scenario: List all registered customers
    When I register a scientist customer "John Doe" with email address "john.doe@gmail.com"
    And I register a chief product officer customer "Sam Smith" with email address "sam.smith@gmail.com"
    Then the customer list is
      | Name      | Email address       | Job                   |
      | John Doe  | john.doe@gmail.com  | Scientist             |
      | Sam Smith | sam.smith@gmail.com | Chief product officer |
```

You can write the following assertion:

```csharp
[Then(@"the customer list is")]
    public void ThenTheCustomerListIs(Table table)
        => _customers
            .ShouldBeEquivalentToTable(table)
            .WithProperty(x => x.Name)
            .WithProperty(x => x.EmailAddress)
            .WithProperty(x => x.Job)
            .Assert();
```

Where, for the example, `Customer` is:

```csharp
internal record Customer(
    string Name, 
    string EmailAddress, 
    Job Job
 );

public enum Job
{
    Scientist,
    ChiefProductOfficer
}
```

You can find more example [here](./src/Examples).

## Mapping between columns and properties

The table asserter is **smart** ðŸ¤“ and try to determine column name of the table, based on
the **mapped property names**.

`EmailAddress` property is automatically mapped to `EmailAddress` column or to more readable
set of words, like `Email address` or `email address`.

The same principle is applied for parsing enum values : `ChiefProductOfficer` value works
but also `Chief product officer`.

It allows to have gherkin scenario closer to **natural language**.

## Override default comparison behaviour

In certain cases, you would want to override the column that is compared to the property.
A second argument of `.WithProperty()` allows you to provide a delegate to configure the `PropertyConfiguration` object.

### Override column name

```csharp
.WithProperty(x => x.Name, o => o.ComparedToColumn("FullName"))
```

It is useful when your gherkin language is different than english but your classes and records still are in english.

> ðŸ’¡ Remember in **DDD guidelines**, a strong objective is to share the **same language across the team / company**, from
> domain
> experts to developers. The code must be aligned to domain specific terms. So in the example, if we decided a **customer**
> has a **full name**
> instead of a **name**, it is preferable to rename the property `Name` into `FullName` instead of overriding the mapped
> column.

### Define conversion delegate

If the column value type (string) cannot be converted to the property type, you must define how the table asserter will
converted it, by providing a conversion delegate.

```csharp
.WithProperty(x => x.Price, o => o.WithColumnValueConversion(columnValue => ...)
```

For example, given the following `Price` record.

```csharp
 public record Price(decimal Amount, string Symbol);
```

If the table looks

```gherkin
Scenario: Created products are listed
    When I create the product "Black jacket" for 100 USD
    Then the product list is
      | Name         | Price |
      | Black jacket | $100  |
```

You can define the conversion as:

```csharp
.WithProperty(x => x.Price, o => o.WithColumnValueConversion(columnValue => Price.Parse(columnValue))
```

## Optional columns

All columns are **optional by default**, so you don't need to specify them all in all
your scenarios. **The ones you specify are used to assert your data**. Depending on your
scenario, you can specify only the ones that are relevant.

From the previous example, a new customer deletion scenario can be asserted only with the column
`Name`, we can volontary remove the `EmailAddress`: because it is useless here, the `Name`
is enough.

```gherkin
Scenario: Deleted customers are not listed anymore
    When I delete the customer "John Doe"
    Then the customer list is
      | Name      |
      | Sam Smith |
```

## Remaining tasks

- [x] natively handle enumeration without converter
- [ ] handle single object assertion (instead of list)
- [ ] add more examples
- [ ] reversed converter from value to column value
- [ ] Provide default list comparison delegate converter
- [ ] handle enum flags
- [ ] provide examples on ColumnValueConversion
- [ ] provide examples on chained property expression to assert sub elements
- [ ] automatic conversion using implicit operator converter
